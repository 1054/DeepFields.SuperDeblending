This webpage describes the IRAC 3.6-micron-selected catalog of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS), released 2008 February. (There was also an earlier release made as part of the August 2007 general EGS data release by the AEGIS collaboration; this catalog supersedes the earlier version).

A more detailed description of the data and catalog are in this paper. The data and catalog are provided for use by any interested party; please acknowledge the catalog paper (Barmby et al. 2008 ApJS, in press) in any published work. For more information about this webpage or the catalogs, contact Pauline Barmby: pbarmby AT uwo DOT ca.

The IRAC data on the EGS were taken in two epochs: 2003 December and 2004 June-July. The co-added mosaics were re-projected with SWarp to put all four IRAC bands on the same coordinate grid and pixel scale. The mosaic pixel scale is 0.61", sub-sampling the native IRAC pixel scale by about a factor of two.

The mosaic images are in units of surface brightness (MJy/sr). The conversion from image counts to flux densities in microJanskys is f[microJy] = 8.7459*(counts); to convert from image counts to AB magnitudes, use AB = 21.545 - 2.5*log(counts).



Catalog production
The averaged mosaics were used for all catalog production and photometry. Object-finding was done using SExtractor, with parameters of DETECT_MINAREA = 5, DETECT_THRESH=1.5 (3.6/4.5) or 3.0 (5.8/8.0), DEBLEND_MINCONT = 0 (3.6/4.5), 0.005 (5.8/8.0). A catalog was created first from the 3.6um image, then sources were detected on the other images and matched to 3.6um sources with SExtractor's ASSOC mechanism. In the area with good coverage and no artifacts (1362 square arcmin), the raw catalogs contain (57.4, 48.0, 16.3, 13.6)*1E3 objects in the 4 IRAC bands.

The catalog contains SExtractor's AUTO and ISOCOR magnitudes as well as aperture photometry in 2.5, 3.5, and 5-pixel radius apertures. Aperture corrections derived from averaged `mosaic PSFs' were applied to the aperture magnitudes but not to AUTO or ISOCOR measurements. A few large, extended objects also had all of their magnitudes corrected by the extended source calibration derived by the SSC (see paper for a list of corrections). Photometric errors are those reported by SExtractor, with a correction to account for correlated background noise. The absolute photometric accuracy depends on the absolute calibration of IRAC, believed to be good to 3%. Please see the paper for details of completeness, reliability, confusion, etc.

The columns of the final, full catalog are listed below. Column names ending in _i are repeated 4 times, once for each IRAC band (i=1,2,3,4 for 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 microns).

In the earlier release, we produced a `simple' catalog, containing only positions and one aperture magnitude (2.5-pixel radius) per object. This was primarily for use in the AEGIS collaboration multi-wavelength SED project.
