After we run the simulations, we got
    xsimuGH_RAD_SPInewX2_100.dat
    xsimuGH_RAD_SPInewX2_100.log
    summary_sim
and a lot of 
    fit*.fits
    fit*.log


Then we can analyze each simu objects 

e.g. we found that a 5-sigma outlier which has a simulated magnitude of "8.100342"
then
    cd doing100
    cat xsimuGH_RAD_SPInewX2_100.dat | grep -n "8.100342"

we got the line number "495:", so the "fit*.fits" is "494"
    ds9mfc fit494.fits

and we want to get its ra dec
then
    cat summary_sim | grep "8.100342"

the first two numbers are ra and dec
then
    xpaset -p GNSkyMap pan to ra dec fk5
