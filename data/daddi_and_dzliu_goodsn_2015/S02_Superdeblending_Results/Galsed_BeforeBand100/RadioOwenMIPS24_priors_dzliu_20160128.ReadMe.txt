Solved issues:

\subsection{Spec-z from various literature issue}

\subsection{Stellar mass from various literature issue}

\subsection{Radio galfit output error got zero value issue}

\subsection{GN20, GN20.2a and GN20.2b source position issue}





Updates:

24um galfit fitting with PSF models (TODO: Gaussian?)

24um galsim correction with 3 steps

16um galfit fitting with PSF models (TODO: Gaussian?)

16um galsim correction with 3 steps

About radio fluxes and uncertainties, we are using Emanuele 2014?'s work. New galfit and galsim were done and show 10% larger uncertainties, and slightly brighter fluxes for faint (~<20uJy) sources.
