# sources from the residual image
# (1) run idl code to create signal image SExtractor_Signal.fits
# (2) run sex to extract additional sources

# Additional notes:
# 
# --> 2015-12-15 --> found 3 to 5 signals from residual image but all are just imperfect bright source fitting features. 
# 
# --> 2015-12-21 --> new SED prediction with crowdiness, now ID 14834 has been flagged out, but there has some residual at its position. Its optical image show two sources, so I'm sure there are two sources at different z.
