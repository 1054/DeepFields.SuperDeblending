Aim:
    
    This is our SED fitting code. 
    See Usage for how to run it. 
    
    
    
Method:
    
    The input is a catalog, and its format should be supermongo's format, i.e.
        first line must be # col1 col2 col3 ...
        then next lines are matched data columns, 
        and commented lines should start with #. 
    The catalog should also contain at least some of these headers: 
        KtotX, _fch1, _dfch1, _fch2, _dfch2, _fch3, _dfch3, _fch4, _dfch4, 
        f24, df24, f16, df16, f70, df70, f100, df100, f160, df160, 
        f250, df250, f350, df350, f500, df500, f1160, df1160
    This code will loop BC03 stellar templates, Mullaney AGN templates, and
        Magdis' <U>-z-dependent DL07 dust templates, to compute the chi^2 
        distributions and hence the uncertainties of various parameters, 
        e.g. L_IR, M_dust, U_mean, z_phot, SFR.
    
    
    
Usage:
    
    We can run either under supermongo environment, or under shell environment:
    
    * under supermongo, fit one source e.g. ID 564:
      
      sm
      macro read AGN_N.sm AGN_Parallel RadioOwenMIPS24_priors_v6_20151221_BeforeBand160.txt 564
      
    * under bash shell, fit one source e.g. ID 564:
      
      ./do_GalsedRunqsub -start 564 -end 564
      
    * under bash shell, fit all sources in the catalog:
      
      ./do_GalsedRunqsub -catalog RadioOwenMIPS24_priors_v6_20151221_BeforeBand160.txt
      ./do_GalsedRunqsub -catalog RadioOwenMIPS24_priors_v6_20151221_BeforeBand160.txt -postparallel
    
    
    
Input:
    
    ./do_GalsedRunqsub -catalog YOUR_CATALOG.txt
    
    ./do_GalsedRunqsub -catalog YOUR_CATALOG.txt -postparallel
    
    * Note that YOUR_CATALOG.txt is supermongo print output format
      i.e. the 1st line should start with #, and contains column headers separated by white space
           the 2nd line should start with #
           the 3rd line and thereafter are data lines, with the same number of columns as the headers
    
    
    
Output:
    
    fit_plots_HDFN/          Plot_SED_*.pdf         The best fitting plot of each source
    
    fit_parallel_HDFN/       ResLMT_*.txt           The best fitting parameters of each source
                             ResLMTfluxes_*.txt     The best fitting fluxes at selected bands of each source
                             ResLMTparams_*.txt     The best fitting parameters of each source
                             fit_*.csv              The best fitting parameters of each source
                             sfr_*.csv              Useless (should use the xfSFR in ResLMT_*.txt)
    
    fit_matrix_HDFN/         fit_matrix*.txt        The matrix of each source
                             resi_*.txt             The resi of each source
    
    fit_chi_HDFN/            Plot_chi2_*.pdf		The chi2 plots of SFR and z of each source
                             Plot_chi2_*.pdf		The chi2 plots of SFR and z of each source
