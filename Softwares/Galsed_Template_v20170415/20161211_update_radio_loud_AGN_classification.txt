Following the discussion with Emanuele and Frazer, we decide to use more restrict criteria to classify radio-loud AGNs. 

Previously we are using:

    f_OBS_20cm - f_SED_20cm > 3.0 * sqrt(df_OBS_20cm**2 + df_SED_20cm**2)

Now we add one more criterion with an AND logical algorithm:
    
    f_OBS_20cm > 2.0 * f_SED_20cm
