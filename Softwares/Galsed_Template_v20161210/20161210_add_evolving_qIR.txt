Following Mark Sargent’s comment, we use an evolving qIR. We use the evolution equation in  Magnelli et al. 2015 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...573A..45M), which is

qFIR (z) = (2.35±0.08)*(1+z)**(-0.12±0.04)

Where qFIR is for rest-frame 42 to 122 μm, not the IR rest-frame 8 to 1000 μm range. To convert qFIR to qIR, they use

qFIR = qIR − log(1.91)
