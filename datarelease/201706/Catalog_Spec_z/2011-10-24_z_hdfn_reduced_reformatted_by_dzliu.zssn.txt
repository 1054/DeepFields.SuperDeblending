# Master list of GOODS-N redshifts, compiling data from all references.
# This is a merged list, where multiple redshift measurements from different observations that match
# a single object position have been compared and resolved in an automated fashion, in an attempt
# to select the single "best" redshift measurement for each object.
# Redshift catalog positions have been matched to the nearest sources from the ACS r2.0z catalogs 
# and the WIRCAM K-band v3.0 catalogs (maximum matching tolerance = 1.0 arcsec).   ACS-matched objects 
# appear first (in order of ACS ID_MOSAIC number) followed by objects with WIRCAM matches only.  
# Note that the WIRCAM catalog covers a larger field than ACS, and therefore objects outside the ACS area 
# will only be matched to WIRCAM sources.  Multiple matches have been reconciled automatically according 
# to quality flags and a priority order for the various input catalogs.  This process is certainly imperfect! 
# so beware.
